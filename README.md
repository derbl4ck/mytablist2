# MyTablist2
This is the last available Version of my bukkit Plugin MyTablist2 which is used for changing the Tablist in Minecraft. A long time ago I decided, that I don't want to continue development of it anymore cause Minecraft got more and more alternative server platforms, version changes and I wanted that the Plugin works on every platform. During this massive testing Problems (cause you cant make it working for all platforms with one jar without problems) and of course adding more features at the same time. So don't expect perfect code at this point. Feel free to use the given code in your own Project. If you want to see the old Plugin page click here http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mytablist/.
